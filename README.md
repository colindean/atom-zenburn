# zenburn theme

[Zenburn](http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/) is a low-contrast theme meant
for long coding sessions. It was originally a vim theme, but it's grown from 
there.

## Licensing

This theme for Atom is based on 
[Colin T.A. Gray's version](https://github.com/colinta/zenburn) for TextMate.

Like it, it's released under the terms of the MIT license.

## Language Support

I've not tested it with anything except Ruby and Markdown, and both seem to
work fine. Because it's a conversion theme, everything that was supported in
TextMate should be supported in Atom.

## Publishing

To release a new version, ensure that everything is set on master and do `apm publish`.

If you forget and manually tag, use `apm publish -t <tag>`.
